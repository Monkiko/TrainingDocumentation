## Description

WordPress is one of the most popular Content Management System (CMS) applications due to its ease of installation, User Friendly dashboard, and supportive Community. As a Linux System Administrator and a Cloud Support Engineer, I have received many questions from individuals learning to work with WordPress as well as had to troubleshoot many errors.

I will be splitting up training topics into quick How-to guides and more in depth guides with a focus of explaining a concept aimed towards a more technical person.

## How To Guides:
* Manual Installation Process

## Technical Guides
* Troubleshooting: Common Errors
